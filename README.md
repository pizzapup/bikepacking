## Application Overview:
Home page for bikepacking.com site. Purpose for creating this app is to showcase design of interactive multimedia applications for desktop and mobile devices using industry-standard tools to create applications emphasizing animation and interactivity. Only HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ScSS/SaSS were used to develop this application. Site is not functional/no active links. 
Some of the features I enjoyed adding:
- sponsor logos 
- navigation hyperlinks 
- multi-device compatible/responsive design
- explore cards
